# My-Fave-Books-Search-Engine

## User Story

```md
AS A coding bootcamp student who has not had the time to read lately
I WANT to immediately search for my favorite books
SO THAT I can keep a list of why I fell in love with them in the first place and make sure to purchase any of my favorite books in paperback/hardcover at home
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN my-fave-books-search-engine
WHEN I load the application
THEN I land on a book search bar page with quick access to Login/Signup popups 
WHEN I am not logged in
THEN I am still able to search for generic books
WHEN I sign up and log in
THEN I am able to save my favorite book using the "Save" button on top of generic book search results
WHEN I click on the option to see my saved books
THEN I am presented with my favorites books and each book as a detailed description
WHEN I click on the Delete button 
THEN that book no longer saved in my list
